## Hero Section Fixed

The hero section now matches the reference design exactly:
- ✅ Title "GIRLSWHOYAP CONFERENCE" at the top (split color: black + mint)
- ✅ Small description box on top right
- ✅ Crowd illustration as background banner (500px height, contained)
- ✅ White event card overlaying the left side of the banner
- ✅ Red "NEW!!!" circular badge in the center
- ✅ "Remind me" and participant count at bottom right
- ✅ CTA section with buttons below the banner

The image is no longer huge and bleeding into other sections. It's now a fixed 500px height background with content properly overlaying it!
