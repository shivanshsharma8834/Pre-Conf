## 🛠️ How to Contribute (Let’s Keep It Healthy)

To make sure contributions stay structured and collaborative, please follow this process:

### Step 1: Create an Issue
Before making any changes, raise an Issue in the repository describing:
- What you want to change / improve
- Why you think this change is needed
- How you plan to implement it (approach or solution)
- Screenshots / references (if applicable)

### Step 2: Get Assigned
- Wait for the issue to be reviewed and assigned to you.
- This helps us avoid duplicate work across global contributors.

### Step 3: Fork the Repository
- Create your own fork and start working on the assigned issue.

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request
Once done, raise a PR clearly mentioning:
- The issue number
- Summary of changes made

Our team will review and merge accordingly.
